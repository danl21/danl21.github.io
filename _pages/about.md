This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

Iâ€™m a lecturer in computational mathematics at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/) at the [University of St Andrews](www.st-andrews.ac.uk)

My research interests are in fluid dynamics, in particular in turbulent flows, please click through to the publication pages for more information, movies, data and code for each piece of work.

These pages are currently a work in process, please bear with me while I populate everything fully. 

About
======
<<<<<<< HEAD

Prior to joining St Andrews I was a lecturer in applied mathematics at [the School of Computing and Mathematics](https://www.keele.ac.uk/scm) at [Keele University](www.keele.ac.uk)
 between September 2017 and May 2022.

Before Keele I was a postdoctoral researcher working at [DAMTP](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk) in Cambridge as part of the Mathematical Underpinnings of Stratified Turbulence [(MUST)](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/env/must) project working mainly with [Colm Caulfield](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/people/c.p.caulfield/).
=======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

From October 2013 to October 2015 I was a postdoc in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.maths.ucd.ie/) at [University College Dublin](http://www.ucd.ie/) working with [Miguel Bustamante](http://mathsci.ucd.ie/~miguel/) on nonlinear wave systems and singularities in inviscid flows.

From April 2012 to October 2013 I worked at the [School of Mathematics](http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/) at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk/) on an EPSRC funded study into [periodic orbits as a basis for fluid turbulence](http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/dynamic/show_funded_project/index.php?project_id=85) working with [Rich Kerswell FRS](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/rrk26/).

I completed my PhD here in the [Vortex Dynamics group](http://www-vortex.mcs.st-and.ac.uk) under the supervision of [David Dritschel](http://www-vortex.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~dgd) working on helical vortex equilibria and an adaptive vortex filament approach to the 3D Euler equations.

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
