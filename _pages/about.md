Iâ€™m a lecturer in computational mathematics at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/) at the [University of St Andrews](www.st-andrews.ac.uk)

My research interests are in fluid dynamics, in particular in turbulent flows, please click through to the publication pages for more information, movies, data and code for each piece of work.

These pages are currently a work in process, please bear with me while I populate everything fully. 

About
======

Prior to joining St Andrews I was a lecturer in applied mathematics at [the School of Computing and Mathematics](https://www.keele.ac.uk/scm) at [Keele University](www.keele.ac.uk)
 between September 2017 and May 2022.

Before Keele I was a postdoctoral researcher working at [DAMTP](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk) in Cambridge as part of the Mathematical Underpinnings of Stratified Turbulence [(MUST)](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/env/must) project working mainly with [Colm Caulfield](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/people/c.p.caulfield/).

From October 2013 to October 2015 I was a postdoc in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.maths.ucd.ie/) at [University College Dublin](http://www.ucd.ie/) working with [Miguel Bustamante](http://mathsci.ucd.ie/~miguel/) on nonlinear wave systems and singularities in inviscid flows.

From April 2012 to October 2013 I worked at the [School of Mathematics](http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/) at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk/) on an EPSRC funded study into [periodic orbits as a basis for fluid turbulence](http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/dynamic/show_funded_project/index.php?project_id=85) working with [Rich Kerswell FRS](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/rrk26/).

I completed my PhD here in the [Vortex Dynamics group](http://www-vortex.mcs.st-and.ac.uk) under the supervision of [David Dritschel](http://www-vortex.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~dgd) working on helical vortex equilibria and an adaptive vortex filament approach to the 3D Euler equations.
