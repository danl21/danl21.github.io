    "# Introduction to Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the obvious questions we might ask about an algorithm or bit of code is \"how long will it take to run?\". Unfortunately, answering this question precisely is essentially impossible. One reason for this is that the behaviour of modern computers is highly optimized and complex. Instead, we often look for an estimate for how the runtime of the algorithm or code behaves asymptotically as the input size increases - e.g., does it scale linearly, quadratically, logarithmically, etc. We also tend to consider *number of steps or basic operations taken* rather than *time*, since these are more independent of any particular computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our context, a \"step\" or \"basic operation\" is something like accessing or modifying an element of a list, adding two numbers, comparing two numbers, or assigning a value to a variable.\n",
    "A quick disclaimer: the discussion here is necessarily a bit vague; to define these notions properly you need to talk about things like a *model of computation*. See MT4512 Automata, Languages, and Complexity for a more precise account.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that these basic operations take some constant amount of time each. The joy of complexity analysis is that because we are only trying to estimate how the algorithm scales, we get to ignore constants. For example, if an algorithm takes $xn$ steps on an input of size $n$, where $x$ is some constant, then for our purposes this is the same as taking $n$ steps - all that matters is that it scales linearly. We would say that the algorithm is $O(n)$, or more precisely $\\Theta(n)$ - more on this notation below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to measure the number of basic operations that an algorithm takes, we run into the problem of what input we should be giving it. It might be the case that our algorithm can handle some inputs very quickly and other inputs of the same size need much more work. In this course, we will mostly focus on the *worst-case*, i.e. the maximum number of steps the algorithm requires to handle an input of size $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a toy example to demonstrate the idea: imagine we have a length-$n$ list `L` of numbers, which we know contains at least one negative numbers, and we are trying to find the first negative number in `L`. We might perform the following simple algorithm: loop through the elements `x` of `L` (in order), and if `x` is negative then return `x`. Here's an implementation of that:"

Until we find a negative number, for each element in the list we perform two steps: accessing that element and comparing its value to $0$. In the worst case this would take $2n$ steps, so this algorithm is *linear(-time)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity analysis of an algorithm is about the *inherent* and *coarse* complexity of the algorithm, rather than the fine details of a particular implementation in code. You can also analyse the complexity of an implementation, and these will match if the implementation doesn't introduce any extra complexity - but in practice it is often worth introducing some extra complexity to make the implementation simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another side to this discussion - what is the inherent complexity of the *problem* itself? Could we solve the problem above, of finding the first negative number in a list, with an algorithm that is faster than linear? In this case, no: if we do less than a linear amount of work, then we can't look at every element of the list (or even any fixed proportion of them) - and we could construct a case where all of the entries we look at are positive but we don't know anything about the others."

You should imagine that $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ either stay constant or trend upwards as $n \\to \\infty$, since for us they represent the amount of steps an algorithm will take on an input of size $n$.\n",

You might prefer to think about this as saying that the ratio $\\frac{g(n)}{f(n)}$ is bounded as $n \\to \\infty$ (ignoring any issues of division by 0), or that $g(n)$ grows no faster than some constant multiple of $f(n)$.\n",

    "### The Best Possible Sort?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen two sorting algorithms, both of which have complexity $O(n^2)$. A natural question to ask would be if we can find a sorting algorithm with a lower complexity, and what the lowest possible complexity would be. The answer to the first question is yes: there are many known sorting algorithms with $\\Theta(n\\log n)$ complexity, some of which we will discuss in the Pure section of this course. The answer to the other question is also known:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theorem\n",
    "Any comparison-based sorting algorithm requires at least $\\Theta(n\\log n)$ comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Proof(ish)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to think about the amount of information that we can gain from doing comparisons. Remember that comparison-based sorting only assumes that you can compare objects using $\\leq$, and in particular the only way we can get *any information* about the order the objects should come in is by comparing two of them. This means that if we perform $k$ comparisons, we can at most distinguish between $2^k$ orders of a list, since each comparison just gives us one of two values. Suppose in the worst-case, we perform $M$ comparisons on our list of length $n$. This means that there are at most $2^M$ different \"paths\" our algorithm can take while sorting the list, imagining each test $x \\leq y$ is a \"fork in the road\" of our algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each different ordering of our list must take a different path through our algorithm (why?) and a list of length $n$ can be ordered in $n!$ different ways. $2^M \\geq n!$. There's a nice result called *Stirling's Approximation*, which is a bit more powerful than we need but worth knowing anyway, which tells us that asymptotically $n! \\sim \\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n$. Taking logs (base 2) gives us\n",

    "That is, we require roughly $n\\log n$ comparisons to distinguish between all the different orderings of lists.\n",

    "You will often see reference to \"amortized\" complexity when looking up how long basic operations take, like appending an element to a list. The precise definition isn't too important here, but the basic meaning is this: if you repeatedly do an amortized $O(f(n))$ operation, then on average over those repeated calls it will take $O(f(n))$ time at worst.\n",

    "This is subtly different from the *average* complexity, where you are averaging over all of your inputs but not assuming that the operation is done more than once.\n",

    "For example, if you repeatedly append to a single list, then it will almost always take constant time. However, when your list reaches certain sizes more space needs to be allocated for it, and this takes a non-constant amount of time. Fortunately, this happens so rarely that when your repeated calls to `append` are averaged out they only take $O(1)$ time. In this course, we won't be picky if you say that something is $O(f(n))$ and it is really only amortized $O(f(n))$."
