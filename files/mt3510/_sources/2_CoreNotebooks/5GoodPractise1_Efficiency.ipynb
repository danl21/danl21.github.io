    "# Good practise in Python: Part 1 Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first of two notebooks where we discuss what might constitute the \"best\" or most appropriate way to program in Python (and beyond). Some of the things covered here will have been, or will be, discussed elsewhere in the module, and many will have been demonstrated to you, perhaps without you realising. Some habits you will have already formed, others you haven't. Therefore, it is a good idea to point out a few important aspects of good practice so that you produce \"good\" code. \n",
    "You may have already noticed that there is rarely a unique way to program a particular algorithm or method. The choices we make when creating the program can have an impact on how quickly the code runs and how easy it might be for others to understand or use. Therefore *good practise* can fall into two catagories **efficiency** and **usability.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "Some features will fall into both catagories, and sometimes they are in conflict with each other, but we will largely focus on the efficiency side in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should also say at this point that this is far from a comprehensive guide; our goal is not for you to be able create *the most efficient* code possible. It is really a prompt to get you started thinking about these issues and not fall into common traps. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What do we mean when we describe a code as *efficient*?\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency, in this context, is mainly a question of time; does your code run as quickly as it could? The choices we make can have a significant impact on how long the code takes to run, for a variety of reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin by looking at some simple examples of different code which seems to achieve the same result, but performs very differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are very useful ways for us to traverse data or iterate a method, however in Python there are often faster ways to perform simple operations rather than loop across all elements in a list or array. For example, suppose I wish to simply add two arrays together, element-wise. We know that it is possible to do the following"

For now we don't consider these issues but it is worth keeping in mind that some problems are so big they can fill computer memory (or important parts of it) or occupy a single CPU for an impractical length of time. One piece of good practise, in terms of memory use, is to manage carefully the number of variables in your program. If variables can be reused, and your naming convention doesn't confuse users, why not reduce the bytes your program occupies. There are ways to manage memory more carefully in Python, e.g. [clear variables from memory](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html) but it is a bit fiddly and rarely necessary in our cases.\n",
