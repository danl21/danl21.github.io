# Chapter 3: Applied Mathematics: Interpolation

This chapter introduces the topic of interpolation which is a cornerstone of computational mathematics in the area of applied mathematics. This topic often appears under the area of *numerical analysis*. Here we will introduce some fundamental aspects of interpolation, demonstrate shortcomings of the basic methods and then talk about improvements, throughout showing example Python code which implements the methods discussed.
