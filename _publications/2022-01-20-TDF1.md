Below is a movie showing the stabilisation of a travelling wave in this case at relatively high Reynolds number (the T1 travelling wave reported in Chandler & Kerswell (*J. Fluid Mech.* 772, 415 (2013)) here at $Re=200$). This makes use of the underlying symmetry of the target solution to avoid the well-known "odd-number" limitation, and dynamically adapts the translation of the feedback term to match the phase speed of the solution.

We are also working on applying this approach to pipe flow using openpipeflow, below is an animation showing stabilisation of the upper branch solution in the $(S,Z2)$ symmetric subspace.
