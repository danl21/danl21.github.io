In semester 2 I will be teaching on [MT3501 Introduction to Mathematical Computing](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/modules/catalogue/?code=MT3510&academic_year=2022/3) and [MT1003 Pure and Applied Mathematics](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/modules/catalogue/?code=MT1003&academic_year=2022/3).


[MT3501 Introduction to Mathematical Computing](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/modules/catalogue/?code=MT3510&academic_year=2022/3)
======
This module gives students a firmer understanding of how computing is used in the mathematical sciences. We introduce concepts such as *computational thinking*, *computational complexity*, discuss best practice with Python and demonstrate how computing is used in Applied Mathematics, Pure Mathematics and Statistics. We use [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks in the module and deliver it in *flipped* mode. I am module coordinator for this module.

[MT1003 Pure and Applied Mathematics](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/modules/catalogue/?code=MT1003&academic_year=2022/3)
======
This module sets up the study of the disciplines of Pure and Applied Mathematics. My responsibility lies in the computational part of the module, leading the computing labs which take place for one hour per week in the semester. We will cover the basics of Python and its application to various problems arising in the lecture content.
