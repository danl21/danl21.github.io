In semester 1 I will be teaching [MT4112 Computational Numerical Analysis](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/modules/catalogue/?code=MT4112&academic_year=2023%2F4)

======

This module combines the theory behind fundamental concepts and methods in numerical analysis (e.g. iterative solution to linear systems of equations, approximation of functions, numerical differentiation, numerical solution to ordinary differential equations) and their practical implementation in Python. The course has a weekly computer laboratory class to make clear connections between the theory discussed in lectures and what is observed in practice. Assessment is by way of projects and final examination.
